Pier One is STUPSâ€™ Docker registry with immutable tags, repo permissions, S3 backend and OAuth 2.0. 

It differs from the public registry in that all tags and images are immutable which are required for reproducible deployments and for internal and external audits. In addition, Pier One respects the notion of teams and allows access to namespaces based on your team.
