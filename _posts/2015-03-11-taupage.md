Taupage is the base AMI allowing dockerized applications to run with STUPS.

As we want to foster immutable (and therefore deterministic and reproducible) deployments, we want to encourage the use of Docker (and similar deployment technologies). The Taupage AMI is capable of starting a Docker container on boot. This will enable teams to deploy ‘what they want’ as long as they package it in a Docker image. The server will be set up to have an optimal configuration including managed SSH access, audit logging, log collection, monitoring and reviewed security additions.
