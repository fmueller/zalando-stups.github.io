title: "Why Stups"
---

STUPS was created with a specific organization setup in mind:

* teams are first class citizens in the organization
* teams are self-organized
* all team members have equal rights
* teams are autonomous and can choose technologies as they think fit
* "team" is the main entity for ownership and security boundaries

This leads to choosing the **one AWS account per team** setup, because:

* AWS IAM policies do not properly constrain teams to only their resources in one big AWS account.[^1]
* AWS service limits do not allow independent teams to work isolated in one big AWS account.[^2]

This setup requires tooling to foster team autononmy while complying with company regulations:

* multiple AWS accounts need to be easily manageable
* compliance rules dictate that all changes to production systems need to be audited ("traceability")
* applications need to have a secure way of communicating with each other across AWS accounts

The STUPS platform was created to facilitate the **one AWS account per team** setup and make the setup audit compliant:

* multiple AWS accounts can be configured by a single tool (`sevenseconds`)
* transparency across AWS accounts is provided by a reporting tool (`fullstop`)
* traceability of changes is ensured
 * by using a standard way of deploying via Docker (`pierone`, `taupage` and `senza`)
 * by logging all human SSH access (`even` & `odd`)
* applications are secured via OAuth (`mint` & `berry`)




[^1]: Not all AWS services/products are properly integrated with IAM, e.g. the Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) service only allows global granting of ELB creation.
[^2]: Team B might hit AWS service limits for production applications because team A spinned up too many instances for performance testing.
